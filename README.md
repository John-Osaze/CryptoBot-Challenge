# CryptoBot-Challenge
Made by John Osaze;
Cryptobot is a website built entirely from scratch during my early days of programming. I built the website to be submitted as an application to a competition
that was held at Edo Bits (where I went for my first Web Dev Bootcamp).
I eventaully took first position in the competition :)
